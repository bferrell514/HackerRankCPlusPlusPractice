Some C++ data types, their format specifiers, and their most common bit widths are as follows:

Int ("%d"): 32 Bit integer<br>
Long ("%ld"): 64 bit integer<br>
Char ("%c"): Character type<br>
Float ("%f"): 32 bit real value<br>
Double ("%lf"): 64 bit real value<br>

To read a data type, use the following syntax:
scanf("`format_specifier`", &val)

For example, to read a character followed by a double:
char ch;
double d;
scanf("%c %lf", &ch, &d);

For the moment, we can ignore the spacing between format specifiers.

Printing 
To print a data type, use the following syntax:

printf("`format_specifier`", val)
For example, to print a character followed by a double:

char ch = 'd';<br>
double d = 234.432; <br>
printf("%c %lf", ch, d);<br>
Note: You can also use cin and cout instead of scanf and printf; however, if you are taking a million numbers as input and printing a million lines, it is faster to use scanf and printf.

Input Format:
Input consists of the following space-separated values: int, long, char, float, and double, respectively.

Output Format:
Print each element on a new line in the same order it was received as input. Note that the floating point value should be correct up to 3 decimal places and the double to 9 decimal places.

Sample Input:
3 12345678912345 a 334.23 14049.30493

Sample Output:
3<br>
12345678912345<br>
a<br>
334.230<br>
14049.304930000<br>

Explanation:<br>
Print int 3,<br>
followed by long 12345678912345,<br>
followed by char a, <br>
followed by float 334.23, <br>
followed by double 14049.30493. <br>
